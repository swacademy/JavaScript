		<p>The <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/workshop/author/dhtml/reference/objects/link.asp">links</a> 
		collection off of the document 
		<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/struct/objects.html">object</a> consists of all
		hypertext links in the page, accessible as an array, starting with the first link in 
		the page and moving down and to the right. However, you can also add an identifier 
		for each hypertext link and access it in the array through this identifier.</p>
		<p>Each item in the collection is a 
		<a href="http://www.devguru.com/Technologies/ecmascript/quickref/link.html">link</a>
		object, which has properties of its own. Among these are those similar to what we found 
		with location: host, protocol, port, search, and hash, each of which returns that 
		specific piece of the hypertext link. You can also access the complete link through 
		the href property, and the associated linked object (text) through text. This can be 
		handy if you're pulling links from a document in a web page, into a handy sidebar 
		reference or other functionality such as this.
